## Architecture and Technologies

This project was created with the following:

* ```JavaScript```
* ```D3.js```

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1

* Create basic skeleton and review the necessary tutorials for D3

### Day 2

* Create the canvas and the randomly generated bars
* Bars should move based on specific sorting algorithm

### Day 3

* Create multiple settings for the data, including a slider for number of particles and dropdowns for sorting type and color theme.

### Day 4

* Finish touchup and styling, along with finalizing the rest of the project.

### Bonus

* Additional shapes to be sorted into
