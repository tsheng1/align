# Radian

## Background and Overview

Radian is a visualization of some of the most popular sorting algorithms. Much of the focus of this project is to not only showcase the algorithms but also to highlight the aesthetics and appeal of data in a 2D space.

## Functionality and MVP Features

In Radian, users will be able to:

* Choose the type of sorting algorithm they want to see
* Choose the number of 'points', which will also determine the speed of sorting
* Choose the color theme 
* Start, pause, and restart the visualization

* Javascript 

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1

* Create basic skeleton and review the necessary tutorials for D3

### Day 2

* Create the canvas and the randomly generated points on the map
* Points should move based on specific sorting algorithm

### Day 3

* Create multiple settings for the data, including a slider for number of particles and dropdowns for sorting type and color theme.

### Day 4

* Finish touchup and styling, along with finalizing the rest of the project.
